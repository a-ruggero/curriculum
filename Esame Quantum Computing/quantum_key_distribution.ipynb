    "In crypthography, key exchange between involved parties must happen without losing confidentiality, availability and integrity.\n",
    "Often, it is necessary to use a public channel to exchange keys, which may be exposed to many risks.\n",
    "A diffused method for this is ciphering the key with public/asymmetric cripthography methods.\n",
    "This key will be used to cipher messages, generally using symmetric cripthography methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most used algorithm for key distribution is RSA, but now that we have quantum computers and new algorithms, new security measures are needed.\n",
    "For example, Shor's algorithm threathens the use of RSA, as it can easily calculate the secret prime numbers that must remain confidential for the security of an RSA key.\n",
    "Also other asymmetric cripthography methods are now threatened.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it's crucial to find new alternatives for key distribution, like the BB84 protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important advantage of BB84 is given by using a quantum system: if an attacker intercepts the exchange, they cannot read the key, as it would mean measuring it. Measuring would make the system collapse into a classical state. This would lead to a relevant loss of information. Plus, all parties involved would notice the anomaly, unlike it often happens in classical computer science, where you can't always be sure your password has not been discovered by an eavesdropper, for example, until they do something to lead the integrity or the availability of related services.\n",
    "Noticing the key has been intercepted, another key could be easily encryptend and sent again.\n",
    "If the key has not been intercepted, all parties involved will have a new secret key, useful to encrypt messages, usually using symmetric cripthography methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make BB84 work correctly, some requirements must be met:\n",
    "- All parties must have access to their own quantum computer.\n",
    "- They must have a communication channel capable of transmitting qubits.\n",
    "- They must have a classical communication channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is impossible to ensure perfect security, we must assume that any of these channels can be tapped into by an attacker.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Alice and Bob want to exchange a key, in a nutshell:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alice creates a random string of bits, and for each bit, she randomly chooses a basis to encode it in.\n",
    "- Alice encodes the bits into qubits using her chosen bases, and sends the qubits over a quantum communication channel to Bob's quantum computer.\n",
    "- Bob also randomly chooses a basis to decode each qubit in. He measures each qubit in the bases he chose.\n",
    "- Alice uses a classical communication channel to tell Bob which bases she chose. She also tells him the first few bits she sent.\n",
    "- Bob analyzes these first few bits to determine whether Eve tapped into their quantum communication channel and intercepted Alice's qubits.\n",
    "- If Eve did not intercept the qubits, they consider all of the qubits that they happened to choose the same bases for, and use those bits as their key. If Eve did intercept the qubits, they repeat the process all over again."
